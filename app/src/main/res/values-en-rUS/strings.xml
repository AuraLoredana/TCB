    <string name="desprenoi">" "It all started with a simple initiative in the spring of 2012 when the taxi driver Ion Cristian Roman wanted to turn a simple trip through Bucharest into a special one. Customers were getting candy, listening to a nice music, or getting an unprecedented tour of the capital. Then the taxi driver thought he could collect books and toys for hospital children, and then go to the Marie Curie Emergency Clinical Hospital every Saturday.\n
"
"
       Over time, hundreds of volunteers and donors, partners in good deeds, have joined in humanitarian projects dedicated to mothers and children in hospitals!

\n
"
"
      The Taxi with Candy is, in fact, a metaphor. Its simple gestures that turn into good deeds, small gestures that can change the lives of others. It is a metaphor of the good deeds anyone can do, because in this taxi everyone can climb!\n
"
"
       The taxi has a few special destinations: pediatric hospitals and schools with special needs in Bucharest.\n
"
"
       Volunteers arrive there to bring smiles to sick and disabled children. In other words, the Candy Cabin is environmentally friendly, it works with love, the love of those who choose to share free time, hugs and stories, children who need hope and encouragement.\n
"
"
        Volunteers of all ages, with various professional backgrounds in Bucharest and abroad, come to read stories to children in hospitals, or to help people with disabilities find their way to life, self-esteem and sense of purpose.\n
"
"
       The association needs support and volunteers in all of its projects!</string>
